    <h1>OpenClassrooms Courses Explorer : et Voil&agrave;!</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
    <p>When you start a <b>path</b> at OpenClassrooms, the simplest way not to get lost is to follow the guideline, from project to project, until success!</p>
    <p>When you start a <b>project</b> at OpenClassrooms, the simplest way not to get lost is to follow the required courses, from course to course, until success!</p>
    <p>When you start a <b>course</b> at OpenClassrooms, the simplest way not to get lost is to follow the guide, chapter after chapter, until success!</p>
    <p>However, <b>courses have prerequisites</b> : it is recommended to follow courses B,C and D before starting course A. And B,C,D require themselves several courses...</p>
    <p>This is where things start to get tricky: 
    <ul>
	<li>Even by <b>reducing healthy learner curiosity</b> (avoid non-necessary references, skip light requirements), you will still need to keep track of all the required courses to achieve a given course.</li>
	<li><b>Cross references, circular references</b> add some fun to your attempt to follow the links: a paper and a pen become bad companions for this journey</li>
	<li>Moreover, <b>Scheduling correcly your projects agenda</b> becomes a <b>time-consuming task</b> itself, with few time for that!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>Imagine you start your journey in an unknown place. Somewhere in front of you a few tracks enter <i>the depths of Knowwood-OC</i> the forest-of-OpenClassrooms-knowledge, but you won't know where they will take you to!
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/spawn_in_the_dark.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it is a <b>purposeful choice</b> to let students find their ways by themselves, to let them discover some treasures along the road if curiosity and serendipity are in a good day, but... Even Dora the explorer has a map, hasn't she?
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/dora_has_a_map.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps the <b>complexity of paths and references between courses</b> has grown with time?
    <br/>Perhaps a given uncertainty regarding the <b>student's preestablished knowledge of the courses requirements</b>, added to a given uncertainty regarding the <b>student's curiosity and available time "to read further"</b>, has discouraged the desire to build a "step-by-step" schedule for each path?
    <br/>Would these sources of fuzziness (complexity and uncertainty) explain the <b>absence of a full path-project-course map</b> at OC? 
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/path_milestone.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>When achieving my third project, I was used to find my way along the courses links, and well aware of the interest to self-discover goldnuts along the way. 
    <br/>I started project 4 with same curiosity, interest, will to learn, motivation as before, and began to take note of the prerequisites for this new project.
    <br/>The cross references between courses, chapters, other courses, other chapters, overwhelmed me progressively with a feeling of being lost again. <i>As we will see soon below, this feeling was totally predictible and understandable.</i>
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/labyrinth.png"/>
    </p>
    <p>After a few attempts to calm down this growing feeling, I came to a first conclusion : <b>paper, pen, post'it, calc-sheet, Jira, ... whatever tool you use to draw your learning roadmap is unuseful without a clear sight of the whole links and requirement-dependencies between courses!</b>.
    <br/>To understand my mindset when I started following the courses of my 4th project, here is a screenshot of the dense relational network between courses of the 3rd and 4th projects in the path "Ing&eacute;nieur IA":
    <br/><img width="600" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/OCCE_projects_complex_zoom.png">
    <br/>In front of such a complex network, one can easily understand that a student can feel a bit lost, and feel a bit uncomfortable when following courses, chapter after chapter.
    </p>
    <p>After very frustrating moments in front of such an undemanded complexity, wondering how not to loose more time, I came to a second conclusion : <b>this is a problem to be solved by a computer scientist, a data engineer, a motivated database architect, and a person who has 2 weeks in front of him!</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I looked around and found out I could do the job: I fortunately had achieved my 3rd project 2 weeks before the deadline, had some robust experience of databases, good knowledge about graphs traversal, and a strong need to practice Python programming (started 3 months ago) to strenghten my little knowledge of Pandas, Matplotlib and other tools. 
    </p>
    <p>There was a final question : is it possible to collect the courses requirements data without breaking any licence? Quick answer : <b>all OC courses are provided with a Creative Commons By-SA Licence</b>. Technical answer : All the data is here, availble and usable for my needs, so let's grab the data and do some automated things with it.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>That was the story , here is the tool!</b>
    </p>
    </section>
    <h2>What is OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>OC-C-E is a tribute to OC : this is the cost I pay to get a full overview of OC courses interconnexions.</li>
            <li>OC-C-E is again a tribute to OC : this is a work motivated by the will to loose less time and embrace as much <b>good OC Courses content</b> as possible to avoid missing goldnuts somewhere</li>
            <li>OC-C-E is a submarine project between project 3 and project 4: I used all python data science programming I had learned the 3 last months</li>
            <li>OC-C-E is an OpenClassrooms Courses Explorer</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </section>
    <h2>What is *NOT* OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
    <ul>
	<li>OC-C-E is <b>NOT</b> a work of OpenClassrooms, it was not demanded by anyone in OC Organization. For this reason, do not ask OC any support or information about this tool.</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is <b>NOT</b> a commercial industrial tool : it is free, it is "as is", and there is a licence to explain how to use it.</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is <b>NOT</b> for me myself and I (anymore). It was first motivated by my own needs, but the product belongs now to the data-python-scientists and other OC students who will want to do something with it..</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Where are the OC-C-E entry points ?</h2>
    <section>
    <ul>
	<li>Launch with Jupyter Lab : several notebooks are provided, one with the full application and some others with tutorial step by step examples.</li>
	<li>Launch with Jupyter Notebook: same as above</li>
	<li>Launch with Voilà: the main application will start with Voilà!
	<br/><pre>voila --enable_nbextensions=True --VoilaConfiguration.file_whitelist="['.*\.(csv|html|png|jpg)', 'viz.*', 'data.*']"  OCCoursesExplorer.ipynb</pre>
	</li>
    </ul>
    <br/><i>See below for installation instructions</i>
    </section>
    <h2>Why OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
    <p>
        The personal story leading to develop OpenClassrooms Courses Explorer is now 3 weeks behind. It took me way more time than expected to finally achieve the scheduling tool. There is no "in-between" approach : between building a bunch of scripts and building a clean application with a documented code, I chose the second one. Moreover I wanted to practice Pandas, Matplotlib, Voila, web scrapping... Now it is time to deliver the job and let you do something with it.
    </p>
    </section>
    <h2>Who can use OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li>Someone with Python + Jupyter understanding</li>
            <li>Someone who knows someone who does that</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For now, I do not plan to make it a standalone "one-click-install" application.</p>
    </section>
    <h2>What can I really do with OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the datasets provided with the application</li>
            <li>Refresh the datasets from time to time</li>
            <li>Explore Topics and Paths</li>
            <li>Explore Paths and Projects</li>
            <li>Explore Courses and Chapters</li>
            <li>Explore Skills (this will be delivered in a later version)</li>
            <li>Schedule your path and take your progression in account</li>
            <li>Plenty things I do not even know, that you will imagine with the datasets.</li>
        </ul>
