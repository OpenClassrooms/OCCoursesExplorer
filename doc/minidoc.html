    <h1>OpenClassrooms Courses Explorer : et Voil&agrave;!</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section>
    <p>When you start a <b>path</b> at OpenClassrooms, the simplest way not to get lost is to follow the guideline, from project to project, until success!</p>
    <p>When you start a <b>project</b> at OpenClassrooms, the simplest way not to get lost is to follow the required courses, from course to course, until success!</p>
    <p>When you start a <b>course</b> at OpenClassrooms, the simplest way not to get lost is to follow the guide, chapter after chapter, until success!</p>
    <p>However, <b>courses have prerequisites</b> : it is recommended to follow courses B,C and D before starting course A. And B,C,D require themselves several courses...</p>
    <p>This is where things start to get tricky: 
    <ul>
	<li>Even by <b>reducing healthy learner curiosity</b> (avoid non-necessary references, skip light requirements), you will still need to keep track of all the required courses to achieve a given course.</li>
	<li><b>Cross references, circular references</b> add some fun to your attempt to follow the links: a paper and a pen become bad companions for this journey</li>
	<li>Moreover, <b>Scheduling correcly your projects agenda</b> becomes a <b>time-consuming task</b> itself, with few time for that!</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p>Imagine you start your journey in an unknown place. Somewhere in front of you a few ways enter the forest of knowledge, but you don't know where they will take you to!

    </p>
    <p>Perhaps it is a <b>chosen way</b> to let purposefully students find their ways by themselves, to let them discover some treasures along the road if curiosity and serendipity are in a good day, but... Even Dora the explorer has a map, hasn't she?
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/dora_has_a_map.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps the <b>complexity of paths and references between courses</b> has grown with time?
    <br/>Perhaps a given uncertainty regarding the <b>student's preestablished knowledge of the courses requirements</b>, added to a given uncertainty regarding the <b>student's curiosity and available time "to read further"</b>, has discouraged the desire to build a "step-by-step" schedule for each path?
    <br/>Would these sources of fuzziness (complexity and uncertainty) explain the <b>absence of a full path-project-course map</b> at OC? 
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/path_milestone.png">
    </p>
    <p>When achieving my third project, I was used to find my way along the courses links, and well aware of the interest to self-discover goldnuts along the way. 
    <br/>I started project 4 with same curiosity, interest, will to learn, motivation as before, and began to take note of the prerequisites for this new project.
    <br/>The cross references between courses, chapters, other courses, other chapters, overwhelmed me progressively with a feeling of being lost again. <i>As we will see soon below, this feeling was totally predictible and understandable.</i>
    <br/><img width="180" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TristanV/OCCoursesExplorer/main/doc/labyrinth.png">
    </p>
    <p>After a few attempts to calm down this growing feeling, I came to a first conclusion : <b>paper, pen, post'it, calc-sheet, Jira, ... whatever tool you use to draw your learning roadmap is unuseful without a clear sight of the whole links and requirement-dependencies between courses!</b>.
    </p>
    <p>After very frustrating moments in front of such an undemanded complexity, wondering how not to loose more time, I came to a second conclusion : <b>this is a problem to be solved by a computer scientist, a data engineer, a motivated database architect, and a person who has 2 weeks in front of him!</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I looked around and found out I could do the job: I fortunately had achieved my 3rd project 2 weeks before the deadline, had some robust experience of databases, good knowledge about graphs traversal, and a strong need to practice Python programming (started 3 months ago) to strenghten my little knowledge of Pandas, Matplotlib and other tools. 
    </p>
    <p>There was a final question : is it possible to collect the courses requirements data without breaking any licence? Quick answer : <b>all OC courses are provided with a cute Creative Commons By-SA \f111 \f112 \f115</b>. Longer answer : let's grab the data and do some automated things with it.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>That was the story , here is the tool!</b>

    <h2>What is OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
    <p>
    <ul>
	<li>OC-C-E is a tribute to OC : this is the cost I pay to get a full overview of OC courses interconnexions.</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is a tribute to OC : this is a work motivated by the will to loose less time and embrace as much <b>good OC Courses content</b> as possible to avoid missing goldnuts somewhere</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is a submarine project between project 3 and project 4: I used all python data science programming I had learned the 3 last months</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is an OpenClassrooms Courses Explorer</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    </section>
    <h2>What is *NOT* OC-C-E ?</h2>
    <section>
    <ul>
	<li>OC-C-E is <b>NOT</b> a work of OpenClassrooms, it was not demanded by anyone in OC Organization. For this reason, do not ask OC any support or information about this tool.</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is <b>NOT</b> a commercial industrial tool : it is free, it is "as is", and there is a licence to explain how to use it.</li>
	<li>OC-C-E is <b>NOT</b> for me myself and I (anymore). It was first motivated by my own needs, but the product belongs now to the data-python-scientists and other OC students who will want to do something with it..</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Where are the OC-C-E entry points ?</h2>
    <section>
    <ul>
	<li>Launch with Jupyter Lab : several notebooks are provided, one with the full application and some others with tutorial step by step examples.</li>
	<li>Launch with Jupyter Notebook: same as above</li>
	<li>Launch with Voilà: the main application will start with Voilà!
	<br/><pre>voila --enable_nbextensions=True --VoilaConfiguration.file_whitelist="['.*\.(csv|html|png|jpg)', 'viz.*', 'data.*']"  OCCoursesExplorer.ipynb</pre>
	</li>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
	<li>Install all packages listed in the file requirements.txt 
	<ul>
		<li>If running a virtual Anaconda environment : do 1
		<ul>
			<li>To ensure ipywidgets will run properly within the notebooks, 
			be sure to install the package like this : <pre>conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets</pre>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If running python VirtualEnv : do 2
